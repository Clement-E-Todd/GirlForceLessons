					<h2>Lesson 2: C# Fundamentals</h2>
					<p>Last time, we started learning the absolute basics of the C# programming language, covering how to create a new
						console applicaition in our IDEs, how to receive and store text input from the user and how to dsiplay different
						messages depending on that input. Today we will be expanding on that base by learning more fundamental C# skills
						such as:
					</p>
					<li><a href="#debugging">An introduction to important debugging skills, like how to run our code one line at a time
						to see what it is doing
					</a></li>
					<li><a href="#types">More variable types that will let us store numerical values, conditional values and more</a></li>
					<li><a href="#operators">More operators (in addition to '=' and '==') that will allow us to write more interesting
						conditions
					</a></li>
					<li><a href="#converting">How to convert data values and types and various useful ways</a></li>
					<li><a href="#loops">How to make sections of our code repeat or "loop" without writing them multiple times</a></li>
					<li><a href="#scope">The lifespan, or "scope" of our variables</a></li>
					<br><p>We will continue writing our code as a text adventure as we learn these skills. You can either expand upon the
						adventure game that you wrote for the previous lesson's homework or start a new one as you see fit.

				<div class="inner">
					<h2>Debugging Our Programs</h2>
					<p>As our programs become more and more complex as we introduce more variables and conditional behaviour, it becomes
						increasingly difficult to accurately understand what our program will do simply by reading the code. Very often,
						need to pause the program and let it run line by line so that we can see exactly what it's doing and why.
					</p>
					<p>This is where our IDE's debugging tools come in handy. Most IDEs allow you to set something called a "breakpoint"
						on any given statement in your program. When you run your program after setting a breakpoint on a statement in
						your code, your program will freeze until you allow it to continue. You decide at this point whether to allow
						the program to continue as normal or whether to step through it one statement at a time.
					</p>
					<p>To set a breakpoint, first find the line of code that you want the program to pause on and click here in Visual
						Studio:
					</p>
					<img src="images/vs_debug1.png" /><br>
					<p>Or here in MonoDevelop:
					</p>
					<img src="images/mono_debug1.png" /><br>
					<p>A red dot will appear next to the line to indicate that the breakpoint has been set.
					</p>
					<img src="images/vs_debug2.png" /><br>
					<img src="images/mono_debug2.png" /><br>
					<p>Now, run your program and play through it until the point where you set your breakpoint. Your program should now
						pause and you will be automatically be returned to your IDE with the current line of code highlighted. Notice
						that while your program is paused via the debugger, you can hover your mouse over any variables you have set
						to see what their current value is.
					</p>
					<p>Your debugger will have a number of buttons that allow you to control the flow of your program while it is paused.
						These buttons will include the options to "continue", "step over", "step into" and "step out". The exact names
						of these features may vary from one IDE to another, and most IDEs will also include other features not listed here
						(though these four are the most important ones). "Continue" will allow you to unpause the program and continue
						running it as normal, while "step over" runs the current line of code only, steps to the next statement and pauses
						again. This is an extremely useful feature for understanding the flow of your program as the computer sees it.
					</p>
					<p>The locations of the "continue" and "step over" buttons are shown below, circled in green and blue respectively. We
						will discuss the "step into" and "step out" features in a later lesson.

			<!-- More Variable Types -->
			<section id="types" class="wrapper style2">
				<div class="inner">
					<h2>More Variable Types</h2>
					<p>In the previous lesson we learned how to create <i>string</i>-type variables, which store text data. However, there
						is a fairly strict limit to how much we can do with only strings. For example, it is not possible to perform
						mathematical operations with string values; if we have a string variable with a value "256", the computer
						understands that to be a series of characters: '2', '5' and '6'. It does not see it as the numerical value of two
						hundred and fifty six. It it important to develop a knowledge of a variety of variable types and an understanding
						of what types to use in a given situation.</p>
					<h3>Numerical Variable Types</h3>
					<p>Mathematical operations are very commonly needed when writing a program, so our numerical variable types will be
						used very frequently. The three numerical types that we will dicuss for now are <i>int</i>, <i>float</i> and
						<i>double</i>.
					</p>
					<p>An <i><b>int</b></i> (or integer) variable can store whole numbers, both positive an negative. <i>int</i> variables are
						very handy when keeping track of information like a player's score or the number of treasures that they have
						found, as these numbers would typically never require partial values (for example, the player can't find half
						of a treasure). We can declare a new <i>int</i> variable the same way that we declare a <i>string</i> variable,
						but we replace the word 'string' with 'int':
						<br><code>int score = 0;</code>
					</p>
					</p>
					<p>When we need to store decimal information, we can use either a <i><b>float</b></i>-type variable or a <i><b>double</b></i>-type
						variable. The main difference between these two variable types is that a <i>double</i> takes twice as much memory
						as a <i>float</i>. This allows a <i>double</i> to be significantly more precise that a <i>float</i> when it comes
						to decimal numbers with a large number of digits after the period, but because it takes more of our computer's
						resources it should only be used when that precision is needed. We can declare a new <i>double</i> like so:
						<br><code>double pi = 3.1415;</code>
						<br>However, this will not work for float values. We will get an error if we attempt to assign a float value like
						this:
						<br><code>float pi = 3.1415;</code>
						<br>This is because when we write a decimal number in C#, the computer will assume that it is a <i>double</i> value;
						it errs on the side of precision rather than memory efficiency. To fix this, all we have to do is add an 'f' to the
						end of the decimal number to let the comuter know that the number should be treated as a <i>float</i>:
						<br><code>float pi = 3.1415f;</code>
					</p>

					<br><h3>Other Variable Types</h3>
					<p>Apart from <i>string</i> and numerical variable types there are a couple of basic variable types that are commonly
						used: <i>char</i> and <i>bool</i>.
					</p>
					<p>While a <i>string</i> contains a series of characters to form a line of text, a <i><b>char</b></i> is its simpler
						counterpart, containing only one single character. That character can be any unicode value, including letters,
						numbers and symbols. As you may recall, we put double quotes around our text when assigning a <i>string</i> value.
						When assigning a <i>char</i> value, we use single quotes instead:
						<br><code>char symbol = 'â™ª';</code>
					</p>
					<p>Finally, a <i><b>bool</b></i> (or 'boolean') is a variable that can contain only one of two values: <i>true</i> or
						<i>false</i>. This is very useful in a number of cases, for instance when you have a feature that can be turned
						on and off:
						<br><code>bool isMusicEnabled = true;</code>
					</p>
					<p>You can also assign a <i>true</i> or <i>false</i> value to the boolean by using a condition (like we saw when writing
						'if' statements). For example, if we want to keep track of whether or not the player's name is Tina using the
						condition <code>name == "Tina"</code>, but we don't want to use the processing power to calculate that condition
						more than once, we can store it in a variable like so:
						<br><code>bool isPlayerTina = name == "Tina";</code>
						<br><i>TIP: If that line of code is visually confusing to you, you can also wrap the condition in parenthesis like
							you would in an 'if' statement to make it visually separate, but this is optional.
						</i>
						<br><code>bool isPlayerTina = (name == "Tina");</code>
					</p>
					<p>Once you have stored a <i>true</i> or <i>false</i> value in a <i>bool</i>, you can use it in place of a condition in
						an 'if' statement or anywhere else that a condition is used:
<pre><code>if (isPlayerTina)
{
	Console.WriteLine("You are the chosen one!!!");
}</code></pre>
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<!-- Comparison Operators -->
			<section id="operators" class="wrapper style3">
				<div class="inner">
					<h2>Making Our Logic More Interesting With Operators</h2>
					<p>So far our logic has been extremely simple, relying on setting variables and reacting if they are set to specific
						values. However, we can have our program react to our data in much more interesting and nuanced ways by expanding
						our repatoire of operators.
					</p>
					<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the computer what operation we want to perform using the data next to it. We
						have already covered two operators in the previous lesson: the assignment operator (<code>=</code>) which takes
						the value to the right of it and stores it in the variable to left left of it, and the equality comparison
						operator (<code>==</code>), which compares the two values on both sides and tells us whether or not they are
						equal as a boolean value (<i>true</i> or <i>false</i>).
					</p>

					<h3>Other Comparison Operators</h3>
					<p>All comparison operators compare two values and give us a boolean value based on the relationship between them.
						As such, these can all be used to write conditions for 'if' statements, among other things.
					</p>
					<li><b>Inequality</b> <code>!=</code> ... Opposite of <code>==</code>: returns <i>true</i> if the values on either
						side are NOT equal.</li>
					<li><b>Greater Than</b> <code>></code> ... Returns <i>true</i> if the value on the left is a larger numerical value
						than the value on the right.</li>
					<li><b>Less Than</b> <code><</code> ... Returns <i>true</i> if the value on the right is a larger numerical value
						than the value on the left.</li>
					<li><b>Greater Than Or Equal</b> <code>>=</code> ... Returns <i>true</i> if the value on the left is larger or equal
						to the value on the right.</li>
					<li><b>Less Than Or Equal</b> <code><=</code> ... Returns <i>true</i> if the value on the right is larger or equal to
						the value on the left.</li>

					<br><h3>Conditional Operators</h3>
					<p>Sometimes we will want to base our decisions on more than a single condition. For example, say we want to give the
						player special praise if their name was Tina AND they scored at least 100 points. We can join two conditions
						together using the conditional 'and' operator, <code>&&</code>, and this will combine them into a single boolean
						value that is <i>true</i> only if the two original conditions were BOTH true.
<pre><code>if (isPlayerTina && score >= 100)
{
	Console.WriteLine("You are truly incredible, chosen one!!!");
}</code></pre>
					</p>
					<p>Alternatively, you may have a special message to give to the player if their name is Tina OR they scored 100 or
						more. For this we can use the the conditional 'or' operator, <code>||</code>. This behaves similarly to the 'and'
						operator, but instead returns <i>true</i> if EITHER condition is true. In the following example, Tina will always
						receive the special message no matter what, but non-Tinas can still get the message if they score high enough.
<pre><code>if (isPlayerTina || score >= 100)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Wow, you are so amazing!");
}</code></pre>
					</p>

					<br><h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
					<p>Arithmetic operators are most commonly used for mathematical operations. For example, if we have an <i>int</i>
						that we've name 'score', we can add 10 points to the player's score like so:
						<br><code>score = score + 10;</code></p>
					<p>Remember though that the operations aren't <i>always</i> mathematical: it depends on the types of values that the
						operator is being used on. An example of this that we've already seen is adding two <i>string</i> values together
						with the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
					<p>The five arithmetic operators to remember are:</p>
					<li><code>+</code>addition</li>
					<li><code>-</code>subtraction</li>
					<li><code>*</code>multiplication</li>
					<li><code>/</code>division</li>
					<li><code>%</code>modulo</li>
					<br><p>While you are most likely familiar with the first four mathematical operations, you may not have heard of modulo
						before. Simply put, modulo gives us the remainder of a division. For example, if we were to set an integer
						variable like so:
						<br><code>int remainder = 10 % 6;</code>
						<br>...the variable's value would be set to 4, because 10 divided by 6 is 1 with a remainder of 4.
					</p>

			<!-- Converting Variable Types -->
			<section id="converting" class="wrapper style2">
				<div class="inner">
					<h2>Converting Variable Values and Types</h2>
					<p>Sometimes we will need to convert values from one type to another. There are a number of ways of doing this,
						depending on the situation.</p>
						
					<h3>Type-casting</h3>
					<p>If the value type that you're converting from and the type you're converting to are similar enough, we can
						simply ask the computer to temporarily treat the value as though it were of another type. We do this by
						adding the type we want to convert to in parentheses immediately before the value that we want to convert.
						For example, if we have the player's score stored in an <i>int</i>, we can temporarily treat it like a float
						like so:
						<br><code>(float)score</code>
					</p>

					<h3>ToString()</h3>
					<p>If two data types are two different, type casting will not work.
						Because we very often need to express data of all kinds as a string (for example, when writing data out in
						the console), C# has a built-in function that can be used with almost any variable or literal value. To
						convert your data to a <i>string</i> value, simply append <code>.ToString()</code> to it.
						<br><code>string scoreString = score.ToString();</code>
					</p>

					<h3>Parse() and TryParse()</h3>
					<p>Just as the conversion from most data types to <i>string</i> is not possible with type casting, <i>string</i>
						values usually cannot be converted to other data types using type casting either. Say that we want to ask
						the user's age and write a special message if they are over 200. We already know that this will not work:
<pre><code>string age = Console.ReadLine();
	
if (age > 200)
{
	Console.WriteLine("That's got to be a record or something!");
}</code></pre>
						We know that this will not work because a string is not a numerical data value, so it is not compatible with
						the 'greater than' operator. However, we can convert the string that we get from <code>Console.ReadLine</code>
						using the <code>Parse</code> function:
<pre><code>string ageString = Console.ReadLine();
int age = int.Parse(ageString);
	
if (age > 200)
{
	Console.WriteLine("That's got to be a record or something!");
}</code></pre>
						Now, if the user types a number using digits, it will first be stored in our <i>string</i> variable, 
						'ageString'. Then, on the following line, we create a an <i>int</i> variable called 'age' and use the Parse
						function to convert 'ageString' into an integer.</p>

					<p>However, doing it this way has a serious problem: if the player types anything OTHER than digits, our app
						will crash! The Parse function should only ever be used when you are 100% sure that the <i>string</i>
						that you are converting contains only parsable characters. Fortunately, we also have the TryParse
						function which, while slightly more complicated to use, is much safer.
					</p>
<pre><code>string ageString = Console.ReadLine();
int age = 0;
bool validInput = int.TryParse(ageString, out age);

if (validInput)
{
	if (age > 200)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("That's got to be a record or something!");
	}
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("I can't understand what you wrote!");
}</code></pre>
					<p>Let's break this code down to see what it's doing. Just like before, we start off by storing the user's
						age input in a string variable, 'ageString'. Then, we declare a new integer called 'age', but this time we
						give it a default value of 0 instead of parsing the text directly into it. The next line is where things
						start to get a little more complex.
					</p>
					<p>Starting at the beginning of the line, we see the code, <code>bool validInput</code>. This means that we
						are declaring a new boolean value. This boolean will have a value of 'true' if the string is successfully
						parsed, or 'false' if the string contained invalid characters.
					</p>
					<p>On the right side of the assignment operator, we see the TryParse function,
						<code>int.TryParse(ageString, out age)</code>. While the Parse function only required that we give it the
						string we want parsed, the TryParse function also needs to know which int variable we want to save the
						parsed number out to, hence the addition of <code>out age</code> (the 'out' keyword allows the function
						to store data in a variable without the use of an assignment operator).
					</p>

					<h3>ToUpper() and ToLower()</h3>
					<p>These functions do not convert the data's type, but <code>ToUpper</code> and <code>ToLower</code> are very
						useful for processing string data. When they are appended to the end of a string variable or value, they
						give us a new string value that casts all of the letters in the original string to upper case or lower
						case respectively. Say that our player has given themselves the name "Andrea". If we write the name 
						variable out to the console with <code>.ToUpper()</code> appended to it like so:
						<br><code>Console.WriteLine(name.ToUpper());</code>
						<br>...then we will see "ANDREA" written out to the console instead of the original capitalization. This
						feature can also be very handy to make our handling of user input in a text adventure more versatile. Say,
						for instance, we have just described a scenario to the player and given them three options of what they
						can do, each represented by a letter. We are expecting them to type 'a', 'b' or 'c', but what if they type
						'A', 'B' or 'C' instead? We <i>could</i> simply use the conditional 'or' operator to check for both the
						lower case and upper case version of the input, like so:
<pre><code>string choice = Console.ReadLine();

if (choice == "a" || choice == "A")
{
	Console.WriteLine("You chose the first option!");
}</code></pre>
						...but that means more typing for us and more processing time for the computer, especially if you've given
						the player a lot of options. Instead, we can simply convert the user's input to lower case up front, and
						that way we KNOW that we're not dealing with upper case text any time we reference the variable.
<pre><code>string choice = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();

if (choice == "a")
{
	Console.WriteLine("You chose the first option!");
}</code></pre>
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>
	
			<!-- Loops -->
			<section id="loops" class="wrapper style3">
				<div class="inner">
					<h2>Looping Logic</h2>
					<p>Many programs, and certainly most games, will require sections of code to repeat on a loop. For example,
						many games will put all of the player input reading, logic processing and graphical rendering into one
						huge repeating block of code, with each repitition being one 'frame' of the game. For this lesson, we
						will just focus on two very simple types of loops: the 'while' loop and the 'do while' loop.
					</p>
					<h3>'while' Loop</h3>
					<p>The 'while' loop looks and functions almost exactly like an 'if' statement; it starts with the 'while'
						keyword followed by a condition in parentheses and a set of instructions surrounded by an opening and
						closing curly brace. Just like an 'if' statement, the instructions inside of the 'while' loop will not
						be executed unless the specified condition is true. <i>Unlike</i> an if statement, however, the set of
						instructions will <i>continue to be exectuted over and over again until the condition is no longer
						true.
						</i>
					</p>
<pre><code>int counter = 0;

while (counter < 10)
{
	counter = counter + 1;

	Console.WriteLine(counter);
}</code></pre>
					<p>In the above example, the instructions inside of the loop will be executed 10 times, writing the numbers
						1 through 10 out to the console window. Then, the condition <code>counter < 10</code> will no longer be
						true, so the program will progress past the loop.
					</p>
					<p><i>WARNING!!! It is a very easy mistake to create an 'infinite loop', which is to say a loop whose condition
						will never become false. For example, in the above code, if we forgot to add 1 to the 'counter' variable
						inside the loop, 'counter' would never reach 10. When this happens, your loop will never stop running and
						you app will freeze!
					</i></p>

					<h3>'do while' Loop</h3>
					<p>The 'do while' loop works almost the same way as the 'while' loop with one big difference: the condition is
						checked <i>after</i> executing the instruction block instead of before. This means that we are always
						guaranteed to exectue the block at least once, even if the condition is false. A 'do while' loop starts
						with the word 'do' followed by the instruction block which is in turn followed by the condition in
						parentheses and a semi-colon.
					</p>
					<p>This can really come in handy, especially in the context of a text adventure. So far in our text adventures,
						if the player entered invalid input, we just had to roll with it. However, we can use a 'do while' loop to
						continually ask for user input until they type something valid:
					</p>
<pre><code>Console.WriteLine("You reach a fork in the road. Which way do you go?");
Console.WriteLine("a) Left");
Console.WriteLine("b) Right");

bool validInputReceived = false;

do
{
	string userInput = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();

	if (userInput == "a")
	{
		Console.WriteLine("You find a treasure chest!");
		validInputReceived = true;
	}
	else if (userInput == "b")
	{
		Console.WriteLine("You find a brand new car!");
		validInputReceived = true;
	}
	else
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Invalid input, please try again!");
	}
} while (validInputReceived == false);</code></pre>
